# English-Dictionary
This is a small project made with Python to find the meaning of the word like a dictionary. Where I am going to use the basics data type list,tuples and dictionary with some basic operations in order to create the Real time dictionary. I used the data.json file as the store of the meaning and i am calling it on the english_dict.py file.
